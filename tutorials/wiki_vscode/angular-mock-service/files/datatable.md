* A data table with all the elements
A data table with CRUD operations is very useful (in our case we only view details or delete an item, but they illustrate two important things: the details view shows how to navigate and consume a parametric route, the delete action shows how to invoke service operations over the loaded data - this means that the component is reusable and when the data comes with an API, only the service will need itâ€™s implementation changed)
